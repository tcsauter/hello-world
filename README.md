# hello-world
First new repository

I'm Travis. I'm fairly new to programming, though I've dabbled as a hobby for some time. I began coding professionally
for a large technology company in COBOL a little over a year ago. While I enjoy that, now I'm working on applying the
skills I've developed professionally to more modern languages, and I hope to apply the skills I develop by doing that
back to my job, as well.
